Please CAREFULLY read the assignment specification PDF. It contains all of the
important information regarding the assessment. The remainder of this README
has a few reminders.

1. Do not forget to submit your academic honest declaration in the statement.txt
file, including any attribution/prompts used in the development of your solution.

2. Do not forget to submit your stackbench.txt if you are a COMP7505 student.
  - Reminder: COMP3506 students who wish to engage in Task 1.4 need to name
  their file stackbench-3506.txt.

3. The expected structure of your solution when unzipped should be as follows:

-| # Project Root Directory 
 | --- structures
 |     | --- m_extensible_list.py
 |     | --- m_single_linked_list.py
 |     | --- m_stack.py
 | -- execute_refgrid.py
 | -- test_structures.py
 | -- statement.txt
 | -- stackbench{-3506}.txt

Data is not required but it is OK if you submit it. 

It should be evident from your submission if something has gone wrong, as the
autograder will fail your tests. Please check the structure matches the expected
one as mentioned above before trying again.

4. Please direct questions to Ed.
